This project is based on CodeBasic's [PowerBI | Sales Insights Data Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uva8pk1FI3iK9kCOKQdz1I9) project.

I first used MySQL Workbench and Excel to clean and ETL a sales dataset. I then used PowerBI to analyze and visualize the revenue and profit across different regions, customers, and markets. I learned to focus on the critical areas (profit rather than revenue, etc.) that a sales manager would be interested in to answer and tackle sales problems. I used basic DAX to return specific data aggregates that could be used in visualizations. I also learned how to integrate the powerful filtering tools in PowerBI to allow my stakeholders to conveniently isolate data within specific conditions.
